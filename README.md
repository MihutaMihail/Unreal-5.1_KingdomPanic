## Introduction
This is my first game using UNREAL ENGINE and the first time that I had to work with a team for a full year. Kingdom Panic, is a tower defense game where the goal is to defend the castle from enemies as long as possible. The game consists of defeating enemies to earn coins to buy new towers or upgrade existing ones.

## About
• The game has been made using BP (blueprints) due to not having learned C++, and time constraints to do so.

• Due to their size (in reference to the amount of nodes insidea a blueprint), and my inexperience / skills to optimize it, there are not pictures of said blueprints. You will have to pull the project, open it inside UNREAL ENGINE, and see for yourself. <br>
