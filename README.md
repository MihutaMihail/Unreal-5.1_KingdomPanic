## Introduction
This is my first game using UNREAL ENGINE and the first time that I had to work with a team for a full year. Kingdom Panic, is a tower defense game where the goal is to defend the castle from enemies as long as possible. The game consists of defeating enemies to earn coins to buy new towers or upgrade existing ones.

## Role in the project
I was part of a team of 4. I led the development team which consists of me and another member. Since I was the person that had more experience in development, I had to do pretty much all of the work. All of my work is included inside the blueprints in the following folders : <br>
→ Tower_Projectiles/ <br>
→ HUD/ <br>
→ Blueprints/ <br>
→ 3D_Models/Tower_Archer/Ballista/Cauldron/Trebuchet

I have also did some work for the "cards" where you can buy the respective towers meaning the design of them, and the little sliding up / down animation.

## About
• The game has been made using BP (blueprints) due to not having learned C++, and time constraints to do so.

• The wasn't much time spend on the actual gameplay, so while it does indeed function, the game is pretty hard.

• Due to their size (in reference to the amount of nodes insidea a blueprint), and my lack of experience / hard skills to optimize it, there are not pictures of said blueprints. You will have to pull the project, open it inside UNREAL ENGINE, and see for yourself. <br>
